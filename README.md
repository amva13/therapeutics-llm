# PinnaclePrism
### Overview of PinnaclePrism
This repo hosts the implementation progress of PinnaclePrism, a therapeutic LLM for therapeutic analysis collaborated with [PINNACLE](https://github.com/mims-harvard/PINNACLE), We focus on contextualizing protein representations by leveraging KGs on PPI networks and single-cell data. The primary aim of PinnaclePrism is to enhance the LLM's capabilities, enabling it to perform in-context learning using Pinnacle embeddings.

## Quickstart Guide
### Installation
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/psui3905/PinnaclePrism
cd PinnaclePrism
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate prism
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Configuration
Get your API key from OpenAI and set it in your environment:
```powershell
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-Aiy...
```
Outside of the PinnaclePrism repo, create a data folder and place relevant drug, disease evidence, and pretrained embedding from [PINNACLE](https://github.com/mims-harvard/PINNACLE) underneath
```powershell
cd ../data
tree
.

 Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ all_approved_oct2022.csv
 Â Â  â””â”€â”€ chembl2db.txt
```
### Usage
To try PinnaclePrism, run:
```powershell
python main.py \
    --rag_folder=../data/theraputic_llm/ \ # Data folder for disease-specific gene expression data
    --llm_database_path=../data/chroma # Database path used for LLM RAG
```

You can query most general therapeutic questions related to any gene, cell type, or disease using the LLM agent. Here is a example:
```powershell

[User]: What cell type is mostly impacted by ulcerative colitis?
=======
[pinnacle] Ulcerative Colitis - EFO_0000729
[pinnacle]: Create gene regulation database under EFO_0000729
[pinnacle] Cleaned query:  Which cell type is primarily affected by ulcerative colitis?
=====
[pinnacle] 1st Attempt:
[pinnacle] Code generation:
===============
import pickle as pkl
import numpy as np

# Load the positive and negative proteins
with open('EFO_0000729_objs.pkl', "rb") as f:
    POSITIVE_PROTEINS, NEGATIVE_PROTEINS = pkl.load(f)

# Count the number of affected proteins for each cell type
affected_proteins_count = {cell_type: len(POSITIVE_PROTEINS[cell_type]) + len(NEGATIVE_PROTEINS[cell_type]) for cell_type in POSITIVE_PROTEINS.keys()}

# Filter out only the cell types related to the colon or digestive system
digestive_system_cell_types = ['colon_epithelial_cell', 'intestinal_epithelial_cell', 'goblet_cell', 'enterocyte', 'colonocyte', 'enteroendocrine_cell']
affected_proteins_count = {cell_type: count for cell_type, count in affected_proteins_count.items() if cell_type in digestive_system_cell_types}

# Find the cell type with the maximum count
max_affected_cell_type = max(affected_proteins_count, key=affected_proteins_count.get)

print(f"The cell type primarily affected by ulcerative colitis is: {max_affected_cell_type.replace('_', ' ')}")
===============

[pinnacle] Code Decision: Accepted
Reason: The code is reasonable and helpful as it specifically looks at proteins affected in cell types related to the digestive system, which is relevant for ulcerative colitis. It also provides a clear output. To improve, it could also include a measure of statistical significance or confidence level for the cell type identified.
